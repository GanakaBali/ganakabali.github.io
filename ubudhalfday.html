Rsi Markandeya lives in Ubud and teaches religious teachings to the people in Ubud and introduces irrigation systems, terrace farming and also teaches social systems such as Banjar, a community organization that is responsible for matters of religion and customs. Until now, Banjar community organizations still exist on the island of Bali. So is the initial story of Ubud Village which found first by Rsi Markandeya and teach religion, agriculture and social organizations.

<b>Ubud Village Name History</b><br>
As for the first time Rsi Markandeya came to Campuhan ubud and taught all about religion and others, so the name Campuhan ubud village became highly respected by the Balinese people and also in the past in this campuhan village there were many medicinal plants used for traditional medicine, so the name of the village "Ubud " comes from the word "Ubad" which means medicine, and in this campuhan village there are many ancient medicinal plants, so it is called Ubad which gradually turned into Ubud.

<br>
<b>Kingdom Period in Bali</b><br>
The period of the kingdom in Bali is known to have started from the 15th century when there was a large-scale exodus of Javanese aristocrats to migrate to the island of Bali. As for some nobles who founded a kingdom called Gelgel which is located in Klungking district, this Gelgel kingdom provided protection for the nobles who came from Java to migrate to the island of Bali, and the nobles who came with the caste system in Bali. Over time the development continued and in the 17th century many new kingdoms emerged on the island of Bali and many houses were also built by nobles called Puri. In addition, at this time there were also many wars between kingdoms fighting for power over regional expansion and other conflicts between kingdoms on the island of Bali.
<br>
<b>The History of the Establishment of the Kingdom in Ubud Village</b><br>
During the war and power struggle between kingdoms in Bali in the 17th century, a prince from the Gelgel kingdom of Klungkung was sent to Sukawati village to build a kingdom that had a palace with architectural beauty aimed at encompassing power in the Gianyar area, the process of building a royal palace in Sukawati This involved many artists from various regions who were sent to Sukawati to make the palace appearance very beautiful in ancient times. After completion of construction, many artists choose to live in the Sukawati area and therefore Sukawati as one of the art centers of the island of Bali, from painting, sculpture, music and others we can see in Sukawati village. After successfully building the palace, the soldiers were sent to ubud to secure ubud where there was a conflict between two cousins ​​namely those in the Padang Tegal area of ​​Ubud and the Taman Ubud area, this conflict attracted the attention of King Sukawati and sent two of his brothers to reconcile the two cousins ​​involved This conflict, and establishing a kingdom in the Ubud area, namely Tjokorde Ngurah Tabanan establishing a kingdom in Peliatan Ubud and Tjokorde Tangkeban establishing a kingdom in the Samabahan area of ​​Ubud with the aim of securing the Ubud area from various kinds of conflicts. Tjokorde Ngurah Tabanan who founded the kingdom in Ubud assisted by King Mengwi filled the Ubud area with residents and with the increase in population here, the economy began to develop and Ubud became very famous in its time.

Although the old Balinese feudal system was superseded by the Dutch colonial government more that eighty years ago, the Tjokordas still retain a special role in Ubud society. Many leadership roles, both sacred and secular are held by Tjokordas. They also figure prominently in the local business community, arts institutions, and professional circles. While no formal power is automatically granted to someone because they come from a puri, the Ubud royals still command respect solely on the basis of their heredity. They also command respect from some quarters on the basis of their rather disproportionate wealth.
<br>
The Tjokordas are no longer the physical embodiment of The State, they are just private citizens, with the same concerns as other private citizens, plus a few more. Accordingly, the Ubud palaces are essentially just family homes, and none have yet been turned into museums of public tourist attractions. While some of them are fine examples of traditional architecture, none are "historical" in terms of age. In fact, most are pretty new. The oldest Ubud palace was located a little to the east of Pura Dalem Ubud, above the main road. It collapsed in an earthquake early this century, and nothing remains but a flat place with traces of foundation here and there.
<br>
<b>Construction of Puri Saren Ubud</b><br>
After going through a period of succession of kings in Ubud, and finally during the reign of Ida Tjokorda Putu Kandel in (1800 - 1823) the Puri Saren Agung or known as Ubud Royal Palace was built, which involved many artists in Ubud at that time to build the establishment of Puri Saren Agung and the function as a place for preserving traditional Balinese culture such as dances and literary works as well as being the residence of the King of Ubud, and after Ida Tjokorde Putu Kandel died there was a change of leadership led by his son, Tjokorde Putu Sukawati, whose reign was from 1823 to 1850, During this reign, the village of ubud became very advanced in all fields, the most prominent being in the fields of painting, carving and dance which made the village of ubud very famous long time ago.

<b>Beginning Ubud Village Famous</b><br>
The first time that the village of Ubud was famous in foreign countries occurred in the early 1930s where many tourists visited the village of Ubud, which at that time the first Ubud Village was more ready to accommodate tourists. Focused on the village of ubud because of the business trust of Tjokorde Gede Agung Sukawati who is fluent in English and Dutch, he set up a small guest house and along with his older brother Tjokorde Raka Sukawati who lives across the street took the initiative to invite famous artist composers such as Walter Spies to come. to ubud and stay in ubud while working. This made the village of ubud very well known in foreign countries, and soon many famous people came to ubud such as Rudolf Bonnet and Williem Hofker who also came to ubud and presented modern painting. And with this, the village of ubud became very famous, and finally famous artists such as Noel Coward, Charlie Chaplin, H.G Wels and also famous anthropologists such as Margaret Mead came. In 1936 Tjokorde Gede Agung formed an association of painters and collaborated between local artists and foreign artists such as Spies, Bonnet and the help of American composer Colin Mcphee who had built a house along Sayan Rdige which was very amazing. Ubud developed a reputation as the pulse of Balinese culture and that image still persists today.

<b>Puri Saren Ubud known as Ubud Palace</b><br>
Ubud Royal Palace with another name is Puri Saren Ubud di Ubud has been a "royal town" for over a hundred years. Its princes, who bear the title "Tjokorda" or "Agung" still live in traditional palaces, called "Puris". Be aware, however, that every place called "puri" is not a royal palace. The word has been used quite liberally of late. Also be aware that there is not one palace in Ubud, but many, most of them clustered around the main cross-roads near the Ubud market. There are several other "royal" towns in the Ubud area, too, with their own palaces, most of which have close family ties to the Ubud Tjokordas. A web of connections is maintained by incidental and arranged marriages among the respective offspring of princes in Sayan, Pejeng, Singapadu, Peliatan, and Payangan's puris. Although the old Balinese feudal system was superseded by the Dutch colonial government more that eighty years ago, the Tjokordas still retain a special role in Ubud society. Many leadership roles, both sacred and secular are held by Tjokordas. They also figure prominently in the local business community, arts institutions, and professional circles. While no formal power is automatically granted to someone because they come from a puri, the Ubud royals still command respect solely on the basis of their heredity. They also command respect from some quarters on the basis of their rather disproportionate wealth. In pre-colonial Bali, palaces were the primary patrons of art, music, dance and literature.
